# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview

The purpose of PyBer analysis is to determine ride-sharing data summary in different city types such as Rural, Urban, and Suburban. This analysis helps to understand what is the total ride per city type, total number of drivers in each city type, total fare collected in each city type, average fare per ride in each city type, and average fare collected by each driver in each city type. Furthermore, second part of this analysis visualize the total weekly of the fares for each type of city through a multiple line plot. The output of this analysis helps to understand what are the areas of opportunities in each city type

# Results:

The result of this analysis indicates that: 
•	Total number of rides performed in Rural area is 125, suburban is 490 and with a huge difference, total number of drivers in urban areas in 1625
•	There were 78 drivers available in rural areas, 490 in suburban, and 2405 in urban areas
•	Total fare collected by drivers in rural areas is $4,327.93, in suburban areas $19,356.33 and $39,854.38 in urban areas
•	Average fare paid by riders per each ride in rural areas is $34.62 vs suburban areas $30.97 vs urban areas $24.53
•	Average fare collected by each driver per ride is $55.49 in rural areas, $39.50 in suburban areas and $16.57 in urban areas
Also, the multiple line plot shows that the is no significant/small up or downward trend in total fare collected by drivers in each city types from Jan 01 2019 to April 28, 2019. The multiple line plot clearly indicates that total fare collected by drivers in urban areas is way higher than other two city types. However, this does not mean a business opportunity since there are way higher number of drivers working in urban areas which lead to smaller fares per ride. 

# Recommendations: 

Inform drivers about available opportunities (based on demand) in different areas so they do not stay only in one area thus, they can earn more also the company can provide a better service in rural and suburban areas.
